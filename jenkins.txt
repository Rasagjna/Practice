-> DevOps is a software development approach which invloves continuous development,continuous testing,continuous integration,continuous development,
and continuous monitoring through out its development lifecycle.

                    STAGES OF DEVOPS:

->  1. version control : source code management.

    2. continuous integration : compile, validate, code review, unit testing,
integration testing.

    3.  continuous delivery  : deploying the build application to test servers, performing 
UAT.

continuous monitoring:

-> 1. VERSION CONTROL
   2. BUILD - Compile
   3. UNIT TEST -testing ,integration testing
   4. DEPLOY- stage where code is deployed successfully.
   5.AUTO TEST - 
   6. DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION
   7. MEASURE+VALIDATE

continuous integration: putting all the code together, merging and building
continuous delivery: 
CI/CD :

-> deployable unit path is called pipeline. The path to the production servers where it is
deployed on to the live servers.
